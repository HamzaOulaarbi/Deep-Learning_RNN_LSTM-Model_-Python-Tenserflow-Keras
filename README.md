# Deep-Learning_RNN_LSTM-Model_-Python-Tenserflow-Keras

In this project we are going to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model based on LSTM layers. The model will allow us to predict the evolution of cryptocurrencies stock prices 3 min in the future

Length of Sequences 60 min / prediction : 3 min in the future 

### Data : 
Time-series of the following  Cryptocurrencies: BTC-USD,    BCH-USD,    ETH-USD,    LTC-USD

    


### LSTM 
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. LSTM are capable to predict future values based on previously observed values. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points (e.g. images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video inputs).
LSTM models are able to store information over a period of time.  they have a memory capacity.
